# [Project 1: New York Airbnb Data Exploration: Project Overview](https://github.com/Rosh-R/New-York-Airbnb-Data-Exploration/tree/main)

Since 2008, guests and hosts have used Airbnb to expand on traveling possibilities and present more personalized ways of experiencing the world. This dataset contains information on 2019 listings in New York and its geographical information, prices, number of reviews, and more.

* Which hosts are the busiest and why?
* What areas have more traffic than others and why is that the case?
* Are there any relationships between prices, number of reviews, and the number of days that a given listing is booked?

# [Project 2: Electric Load Forecasting: Project Overview](https://github.com/Rosh-R/Electric-Load-Forecasting)

## Objective

We are very much dependent to the Electricity. It is our reponsibility to prevent from a catastrophic power failure. To prevent this we need to do some precautionary measures.
* We must have a balance between power consumption and production, when this equilibrium falls apart we experience power failure at the particular locality.
* It is important to steady the usage of the customers to prevent any faults occuring in the power system.

## Solution

### [Clustering the Household with respect to their Electric load consumption](https://github.com/Rosh-R/Electric-Load-Forecasting/blob/main/Load%20Forecasting%20Clustering.ipynb)
### Forecasting Electric Load in order to be ready for the worst case scenario
